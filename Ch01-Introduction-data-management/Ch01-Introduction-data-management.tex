\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Data are a product.
\item Data product has a life-cycle as following (simplified): 
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item \textbf{Question}, Idea, or service.
	\item \textbf{Identifying} the source of information and the data type ex: (text, images, videos, audio, or sensors).
	\item \textbf{Document} all details regarding the data including quality, security, efficiency, and access (consideration during the cycle).
	\item Delivery automation (Tools and Process) AKA \textbf{DevOps} cycle.
	\item \textbf{Extraction} Process (collection).
	\item \textbf{Transformation} ex: (cleansing, Apply business logic, Organize).
	\item \textbf{Loading} or store the transformed data based on our usage or use case.
	\item Business Intelligence (\textbf{BI}) or data discovery (continues process).
	\item \textbf{Integration} and publishing.
	\item Data retention or \textbf{archiving} process ex: (Hot or Cold storage).

%	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
%		\item You hired at a company which doesn’t have any system.
%		\item You started to collect all the data from files into CSV file format.
%		\item You built a system which read the data from CSV files.
%		\item Your manager asked you to create some report which required to combine different component.
%		\item After successfully generate this reports your manager asked you to create 100+ reports to support other departments.
%		\item For optimization purpose you changed the files from CSV into Json and update the searching mechanism into the files.

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item How can we think about a data solution or challenges in the data products?
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Requirements analysis.
			\item Identify the problem (challenges).
			\item Think about how to overcome the challenges.
			\item Ask your self the following questions:
			\begin{itemize}[<+->]
				\item Can we solve the problem using the current data structure with adding new features?
				\item What if we enhance/change the data structure or modeling?
				\item Could it help if we change the backend engine (ex: DBMS system)?
			\end{itemize}			
		\end{itemize}
		\item To answer these questions you need to understand the \textbf{\underline{data layers}}.

	\frametitle{Data Layers (Abstraction)}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Any data product (database) contains multi-layers.
		\item Each layer responsible for different tasks and operations.
		\item Each layers interacts with (hardware or software or mixed).
		\item To eliminate the complexity for data interactions not all internal processes are shared or available for the user.
		\item The developer for each layer hide internal irrelevant details from developer (users). 
		\item The process of \textbf{\underline{\blue{hiding}}} irrelevant details from developer (user) is called data \textbf{\underline{\blue{abstraction}}}.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Data Layers (Abstraction)}
	\begin{definition}
		\textbf{Data Abstraction and Data Independence}: DBMS comprise of complex data-structures. In order to make the system efficient in terms of retrieval of data, and reduce complexity in terms of usability of users, developers use abstraction i.e. hide irrelevant details from the users. This approach simplifies database design.

Types of Data Warehouse
\begin{description}
\item [\textbf{Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDWH)}] It provides decision support service across the enterprise. It offers a unified approach for organizing and representing data (DWH Model). It offers data classifications according to the subject with privileges policy.
\item [\textbf{Operational Data Store (ODS):}] is a central database that provides an up-to-date (real-time) data from multiple transnational systems for operational reporting into a single DWH.

%% for real time questions and answers. call ODS using intermidiate data store. DWH is day -1 (billing & subscribtions). Oracle (Loading or headache) && CDC capture change interest column not row
\item [\textbf{Data Mart:}] A data mart is a subset of the data warehouse. It specially designed for a particular line of business, such as sales, finance, sales or finance. In an independent data mart, data can collect directly from sources.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item The CRM system handles the customer activities with the company including (sales, change in customer plans, and other activities).
\item This system has a backend database (MySQL).
\item CRM team can report their sales and customer activities from their database.
\item Product owner can take a decision based on their system backend reports.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item This company has other systems for example: billing, charging, signaling.	
\item They need to report information related to the CRM, billing, and signaling source systems in one report.
\item So, they need to ingest (transfer) the data from the source systems to one single database.
\item The decision from the DHW is a \textbf{global and strategical decision.}
\item If the company needs to build a machine learning model which needs data from different sources. They need to load the data from a centralized database rather than read each source alone.

\item The characteristics of DWH:
	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item Integrated: \textit{DWH is an integrated environment which allows us to integrate different source systems. Data are modeled (organized) into a unified manner.} %regardless of the original source
	
		\item Time-Variant: \textit{Data modeled (organized) based on time periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.)}
	
		\item Subject-oriented: \textit{DWH main target is to support business needs for the whole organization including (decision makers, departments, and specific user requirements)}.
	
		\item Non-Volatile: \textit{It refers to the data will not erased or deleted (It could be archived and retrieved when needed). Data can be accumulated daily the new snapshots (refreshed at based on the source system interval. For example, It could be updated daily, weekly, and monthly).}

\frametitle{What is data model?}
Data model is
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item An abstract model that organizes elements of data.
	\item It describes the objects, entities and data structure properties, semantic, and constraint.
	\item It formalizes the relationship between entities.
	\item It describes how application (report) API data manipulation.
	\item It describes the conceptual design of a business or an application with its flow, logic, semantic information (rules), and how things are done.
	\item It refers to a set of concepts used in defining such as entities, attributes, relations, or tables.

Data model is not	
\begin{itemize}
	\item a science.
	\item a static design for each organization.
	\item a type of database.
	\item a new invention which needs to be done for each project.
\end{itemize}


Data model is		
\begin{itemize}
	\item an engineering design practices.
	\item a general concepts which lead to build full architecture.
	\item different based on the use case and the database type.
	\item customizable and we can utilize some of ready built architecture. 
	\item implementing using different ways.
	\item affecting the information reporting performance and ways.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item You need to build a home. So, how do we design this home?
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Determine if the home is one level or multi-level and decide man bedrooms and bathrooms for each floor. (User needs)
			\item Hire an architect to put the architecture in more detailed way for example, the size for each room, the distribution of the wireds, where the plumbing fixtures will be placed, etc. (Architecture phase)
			\item Decide the decorations, colors for each room, carpets, etc. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item What do we do for the implementation?
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Hire a contractor to build (implement the design) the home. 
			\item This phase will implement the design but it also include some detail related to the actual way to build the tools and the material. (Physical Design)
