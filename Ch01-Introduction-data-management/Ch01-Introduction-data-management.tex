\frametitle{Data Management}

\begin{itemize}
\item Data are a product.
\item Data product has a life-cycle as following (simplified): 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Question}, Idea, or service.
	\item \textbf{Identifying} the source of information and the data type ex: (text, images, videos, audio, or sensors).
	\item \textbf{Document} all details regarding the data including quality, security, efficiency, and access (consideration during the cycle).
	\item Delivery automation (Tools and Process) AKA \textbf{DevOps} cycle.
	\item \textbf{Extraction} Process (collection).
	\item \textbf{Transformation} ex: (cleansing, Apply business logic, Organize).
	\item \textbf{Loading} or store the transformed data based on our usage or use case.
	\item Business Intelligence (\textbf{BI}) or data discovery (continues process).
	\item \textbf{Integration} and publishing.
	\item Data retention or \textbf{archiving} process ex: (Hot or Cold storage).

\subsection{From DWH to Big Data}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation to Data Warehouse}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Data could be a product for some companies.
\item It could be decision support for other products or businesses.
\item Reporting the results after pass the data life-cycle will be from storage (Database).
\item There are some challenges facing the people who work on data management backend:
\begin{itemize}
\item Performance.
\item Integration.
\item Applying analytical functions. %Moving average
\end{itemize}
\item Vendors who are working to solve the above challenges creating their own product of DWH and their ultimate work is to optimize the above points.

\begin{itemize}
\item The DWH is not a product but an environment.
\item It is a process of transforming data into information and make it available to users in a \textbf{timely manner} to make a difference.
\item It is an architectural construct of an information system which provides users with current and historical decision support information which is difficult to access or present in the traditional operational data store.
\item The DWH is the core of the BI system which is built for data analysis and reporting.

\frametitle{Motivation to Data Warehouse}

Data warehouse system is also known by the following names:


\begin{wideitemize}
\item Decision Support System (DSS).
\item Business Intelligence Solution.
\item Executive Information System.
\item Management Information System.
\item Analytic Application.
\item Data Warehouse.

\end{wideitemize}

The real concept was given by Inmon Bill. He was considered as a father of the DWH. He had written about a variety of topics for building, usage, and maintenance of the warehouse \& the Corporate Information Factory

\frametitle{Motivation to Data Warehouse}
Types of Data Warehouse
\begin{description}
\item [\textbf{Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDWH)}] It provides decision support service across the enterprise. It offers a unified approach for organizing and representing data (DWH Model). It offers data classifications according to the subject with privileges policy.
\item [\textbf{Operational Data Store (ODS):}] is a central database that provides an up-to-date (real-time) data from multiple transnational systems for operational reporting into a single DWH.

%% for real time questions and answers. call ODS using intermidiate data store. DWH is day -1 (billing & subscribtions). Oracle (Loading or headache) && CDC capture change interest column not row
\item [\textbf{Data Mart:}] A data mart is a subset of the data warehouse. It specially designed for a particular line of business, such as sales, finance, sales or finance. In an independent data mart, data can collect directly from sources.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item A telecommunication company named \textbf{XTec}.
\newline
\item They have lots of systems. One of this systems is a CRM system as example of operational DB.
\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item The CRM system handles the customer activities with the company including (sales, change in customer plans, and other activities).
\item This system has a backend database (MySQL).
\item CRM team can report their sales and customer activities from their database.
\item Product owner can take a decision based on their system backend reports.

\frametitle{Use case (DWH)}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item What is the need for DWH?		
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item This company has other systems for example: billing, charging, signaling.	
\item They need to report information related to the CRM, billing, and signaling source systems in one report.
\item So, they need to ingest (transfer) the data from the source systems to one single database.
\item The decision from the DHW is a \textbf{global and strategical decision.}
\item If the company needs to build a machine learning model which needs data from different sources. They need to load the data from a centralized database rather than read each source alone.

\textbf{XTec} has a call center system which handles the customer inquiries. This system requires the some data related to usage, customer information, billing details to be calculated and accumulated in \textbf{real-time} to be able to give the customer the right answer for his inquires.

\frametitle{Use case (ODS)}

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item So, What is the challenge for this system?
			\begin{itemize}[<+->]		
				\item It needs specific information from different source systems.
				\item It requires to track the source system database changes or update in real-time.
				\item It's functionality is based on the aggregate data not the transactions for example (It needs the total outgoing calls till time or it needs the total charging amounts from prepaid or the available limits from billing if it is postpaid).

\frametitle{Use case (ODS)}

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item ODS is based on change data capture (CDC). This approach used to determine the data change and apply action based on this change.
		\item ODS uses the real-time aggregations to support the online systems from different source systems.

\frametitle{Data Model Design vs Implementation}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item You need to build a home. So, how do we design this home?
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Determine if the home is one level or multi-level and decide man bedrooms and bathrooms for each floor. (User needs)
			\item Hire an architect to put the architecture in more detailed way for example, the size for each room, the distribution of the wireds, where the plumbing fixtures will be placed, etc. (Architecture phase)
			\item Decide the decorations, colors for each room, carpets, etc. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item What do we do for the implementation?
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Hire a contractor to build (implement the design) the home. 
			\item This phase will implement the design but it also include some detail related to the actual way to build the tools and the material. (Physical Design)
