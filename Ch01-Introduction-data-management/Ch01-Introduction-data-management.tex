%		\item Your manager asked you to create some report which required to combine different component.
%		\item After successfully generate this reports your manager asked you to create 100+ reports to support other departments.

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item How can we think about a data solution or challenges in the data products?
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Requirements analysis.
			\item Identify the problem (challenges).
			\item Think about how to overcome the challenges.
			\item Ask your self the following questions:
			\begin{itemize}[<+->]
				\item Can we solve the problem using the current data structure by adding new features?
				\item What if we enhance/change the data structure or modeling?
				\item Could it help if we change the backend engine (ex: DBMS system)?
			\end{itemize}			
		\end{itemize}
		\item To answer these questions you need to understand the \textbf{\underline{data layers}}.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Data Layers (Abstraction)}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Any data product (database) contains multi-layers.
		\item Each layer responsible for different tasks and operations.
		\item Each layer interacts with (hardware or software or mixed).
		\item Eliminate the complexity of data interactions; not all internal processes are shared or available for the user.
		\item The developer for each layer hides irrelevant internal details from the developer (users). 
		\item The process of \textbf{\underline{\blue{hiding}}} irrelevant details from the developer (user) is called data \textbf{\underline{\blue{abstraction}}}.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Data Layers (Abstraction)}
	\begin{definition}
		\textbf{Data Abstraction and Data Independence}: DBMS comprises complex data-structures. To make the system efficient in terms of retrieval of data and reduce complexity in terms of usability of users, developers use abstraction i.e., hide irrelevant details from the users. This approach simplifies database design.

The real concept was given by Inmon Bill. He was considered as a father of the DWH. He had written about a variety of topics for building, usage, and maintenance of the warehouse \& the Corporate Information Factory

	\item It is a process of transforming data into information and make it available to users in a \textbf{timely manner} to make a difference.
	\item It is an architectural construct of an information system which provides users with current and historical decision support information which is difficult to access or present in the traditional operational data store.
	\item The DWH is the core of the BI system which is built for data analysis and reporting.

Types of Data Warehouse
\begin{description}
\item [\textbf{Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDWH)}] It provides decision support service across the enterprise. It offers a unified approach for organizing and representing data (DWH Model). It offers data classifications according to the subject with privileges policy.
\item [\textbf{Operational Data Store (ODS):}] is a central database that provides an up-to-date (real-time) data from multiple transnational systems for operational reporting into a single DWH.

%% for real time questions and answers. call ODS using intermidiate data store. DWH is day -1 (billing & subscribtions). Oracle (Loading or headache) && CDC capture change interest column not row
\item [\textbf{Data Mart:}] A data mart is a subset of the data warehouse. It specially designed for a particular line of business, such as sales, finance, sales or finance. In an independent data mart, data can collect directly from sources.

\item A telecommunication company named \textbf{XTec}.
\newline
\item They have lots of systems. One of this systems is a CRM system as example of operational DB.
\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item The CRM system handles the customer activities with the company including (sales, change in customer plans, and other activities).
\item This system has a backend database (MySQL).
\item CRM team can report their sales and customer activities from their database.
\item Product owner can take a decision based on their system backend reports.

\frametitle{Use case (DWH)}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item What is the need for DWH?		
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item This company has other systems for example: billing, charging, signaling.	
\item They need to report information related to the CRM, billing, and signaling source systems in one report.
\item So, they need to ingest (transfer) the data from the source systems to one single database.
\item The decision from the DHW is a \textbf{global and strategical decision.}
\item If the company needs to build a machine learning model which needs data from different sources. They need to load the data from a centralized database rather than read each source alone.

				\item It requires to track the source system database changes or update in real-time.
				\item It's functionality is based on the aggregate data not the transactions for example (It needs the total outgoing calls till time or it needs the total charging amounts from prepaid or the available limits from billing if it is postpaid).

		\item Subject-oriented: \textit{DWH main target is to support business needs for the whole organization including (decision makers, departments, and specific user requirements)}.
	
		\item Non-Volatile: \textit{It refers to the data will not erased or deleted (It could be archived and retrieved when needed). Data can be accumulated daily the new snapshots (refreshed at based on the source system interval. For example, It could be updated daily, weekly, and monthly).}
