	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item How can we think about a data solution or challenges in the data products?
		\begin{itemize}[<+->]
			\item Requirements analysis.
			\item Identify the problem (challenges).
			\item Think about how to overcome the challenges.
			\item Ask your self the following questions:
			\begin{itemize}[<+->]
				\item Can we solve the problem using the current data structure by adding new features?
				\item What if we enhance/change the data structure or modeling?
				\item Could it help if we change the backend engine (ex: DBMS system)?
			\end{itemize}			
		\end{itemize}
		\item To answer these questions you need to understand the \textbf{\underline{data layers}}.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Data Layers (Abstraction)}
	\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Any data product (database) contains multi-layers.
		\item Each layer responsible for different tasks and operations.
		\item Each layer interacts with (hardware or software or mixed).
		\item Eliminate the complexity of data interactions; not all internal processes are shared or available for the user.
		\item The developer for each layer hides irrelevant internal details from the developer (users). 
		\item The process of \textbf{\underline{\blue{hiding}}} irrelevant details from the developer (user) is called data \textbf{\underline{\blue{abstraction}}}.
	\end{itemize}	
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Data Layers (Abstraction)}
	\begin{definition}
		\textbf{Data Abstraction and Data Independence}: DBMS comprises complex data-structures. To make the system efficient in terms of retrieval of data and reduce complexity in terms of usability of users, developers use abstraction i.e., hide irrelevant details from the users. This approach simplifies database design.

	\begin{itemize}[<+->]

				\begin{itemize}[<+->]				
					\item Using a new storage device
					\item Change the structure of the data used for storage
					\item Change the file type or use a different storage structure
					\item Chang the access method
					\item Modify indexes

Types of Data Warehouse
\begin{description}
\item [\textbf{Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDWH)}] It provides decision support service across the enterprise. It offers a unified approach for organizing and representing data (DWH Model). It offers data classifications according to the subject with privileges policy.
\item [\textbf{Operational Data Store (ODS):}] is a central database that provides an up-to-date (real-time) data from multiple transnational systems for operational reporting into a single DWH.

%% for real time questions and answers. call ODS using intermidiate data store. DWH is day -1 (billing & subscribtions). Oracle (Loading or headache) && CDC capture change interest column not row
\item [\textbf{Data Mart:}] A data mart is a subset of the data warehouse. It specially designed for a particular line of business, such as sales, finance, sales or finance. In an independent data mart, data can collect directly from sources.

\item They have lots of systems. One of this systems is a CRM system as example of operational DB.
\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item The CRM system handles the customer activities with the company including (sales, change in customer plans, and other activities).
\item This system has a backend database (MySQL).
\item CRM team can report their sales and customer activities from their database.
\item Product owner can take a decision based on their system backend reports.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item What is the need for DWH?		
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item This company has other systems for example: billing, charging, signaling.	
\item They need to report information related to the CRM, billing, and signaling source systems in one report.
\item So, they need to ingest (transfer) the data from the source systems to one single database.
\item The decision from the DHW is a \textbf{global and strategical decision.}
\item If the company needs to build a machine learning model which needs data from different sources. They need to load the data from a centralized database rather than read each source alone.

				\item It needs specific information from different source systems.
				\item It requires to track the source system database changes or update in real-time.
				\item It's functionality is based on the aggregate data not the transactions for example (It needs the total outgoing calls till time or it needs the total charging amounts from prepaid or the available limits from billing if it is postpaid).

	\begin{wideitemize}
		\item Integrated: \textit{DWH is an integrated environment which allows us to integrate different source systems. Data are modeled (organized) into a unified manner.} %regardless of the original source
	
		\item Time-Variant: \textit{Data modeled (organized) based on time periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.)}
	
		\item Subject-oriented: \textit{DWH main target is to support business needs for the whole organization including (decision makers, departments, and specific user requirements)}.
	
		\item Non-Volatile: \textit{It refers to the data will not erased or deleted (It could be archived and retrieved when needed). Data can be accumulated daily the new snapshots (refreshed at based on the source system interval. For example, It could be updated daily, weekly, and monthly).}

	%measure and ids when,where
	\item[Dimensions] provide the context surrounding a business process event. In simple terms, they give who, what, where of a fact. Ex: (Telecom industry, for the fact daily usage, dimensions would be Who – (Customer id), Where (Location), What (counts of activities incoming/outgoing call) ) 

	\item[Attributes] are the various characteristics of the dimension.	In the previous examples the attributes can be customer details (from customer id get the gender, age, nationality, etc..).
	%Attributes are used to search, filter, or classify facts. Dimension Tables contain Attributes

		\item[Dimension table] contains dimensions of a fact and business reference data. They are joined to fact table via a foreign key. Dimension tables are de-normalized tables. It connected to the fact table and located at the edges of the star or snowflake schema.

		\item[Conformed Dimensions]	the dimension which is identical and has the same meaning across many fact tables which it relates and used in different areas of the warehouse. Ex: if we have date column across many facts we could use date as key in all table. So, it will be unified format. Another example if we have product name which same product could vary between systems ex: (upper/lower) we can create dimension table for the product details and use product id unified across fact tables. 
		
		\item[Outrigger Dimensions]	A dimension may have a reference to another dimension table. These secondary dimensions called outrigger dimensions. This kind of Dimensions should be used carefully.
		\item[Shrunken Rollup Dimensions]	Shrunken Rollup dimensions are a subdivision of rows and columns of a base dimension. These kinds of dimensions are useful for developing aggregated fact tables.
		\item[Dimension-to-Dimension] Table Joins	Dimensions may have references to other dimensions. However, these relationships can be modeled with outrigger dimensions.

	\item[Junk Dimensions]	It a collection of random transactional codes, flags or text attributes. It may not logically belong to any specific dimension.
	\item[Degenerate Dimensions]	Degenerate dimension is without corresponding dimension. It is used in the transaction and collecting snapshot fact tables. This kind of dimension does not have its dimension as it is derived from the fact table.
	\item[Swappable Dimensions]	They are used when the same fact table is paired with different versions of the same dimension.
	\item[Step Dimensions]	Sequential processes, like web page events, mostly have a separate row in a fact table for every step in a process. It tells where the specific step should be used in the overall session.
