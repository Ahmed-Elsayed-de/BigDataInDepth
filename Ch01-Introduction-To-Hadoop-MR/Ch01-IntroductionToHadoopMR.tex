\frametitle{Data Management}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data are a product.
	\item Data product has a life-cycle as following (simplified): 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Question}, Idea, or service.
		\item \textbf{Identifying} the source of information and the data type ex: (text, images, videos, audio, or sensors).
		\item \textbf{Document} all details regarding the data including quality, security, efficiency, and access (consideration during the cycle).
%		\item Delivery automation (Tools and Process) AKA \textbf{DevOps} cycle.
		\item \textbf{Extraction} Process (collection).
		\item \textbf{Transformation} ex: (cleansing, Apply business logic, Organize).
		\item \textbf{Loading} or store the transformed data based on our usage or use case.
		\item Business Intelligence (\textbf{BI}) or data discovery (continues process).
		\item \textbf{Integration} and publishing.
		\item Data retention or \textbf{archiving} process ex: (Hot or Cold storage).
