\subsection{Data Management}

\frametitle{Data Management}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data are a product.
	\item Data product has a life-cycle as following (simplified): 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Question}, Idea, or service.
		\item \textbf{Identifying} the source of information and the data type ex: (text, images, videos, audio, or sensors).
		\item \textbf{Document} all details regarding the data including quality, security, efficiency, and access (consideration during the cycle).
		\item Delivery automation (Tools and Process) AKA \textbf{DevOps} cycle.
		\item \textbf{Extraction} Process (collection).
		\item \textbf{Transformation} ex: (cleansing, Apply business logic, Organize).
		\item \textbf{Loading} or store the transformed data based on our usage or use case.
		\item Business Intelligence (\textbf{BI}) or data discovery (continues process).
		\item \textbf{Integration} and publishing.
		\item Data retention or \textbf{archiving} process ex: (Hot or Cold storage).

\subsection{From DWH to Big Data}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation to Data Warehouse}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
	\item Data could be a product for some companies.
	\item It could be decision support for other products or businesses.
	\item Reporting the results after pass the data life-cycle will be from storage (Database).
	\item There are some challenges facing the people who work on data management backend:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Performance.
		\item Integration.
		\item Applying analytical functions. %Moving average
	\end{itemize}
	\item Vendors who are working to solve the above challenges creating their own product of DWH and their ultimate work is to optimize the above points.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{DWH vs Operational databases}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
		\item Operational databases (Transactions DB) still working as the backend for the products.
		\item Data warehouse mainly works as centralized storage for all the source systems regardless of the product type or their functionality.
		\item Data warehouse designed to solve the \textbf{huge amount of data}.
		\item Most of DWH can't solve the online transactions similar to the transaction DB.
		\item Transactions databases have a performance issue while handling a huge amount of data. So, analysis of a huge amount of data (including historical data)Â we used DWH for this purpose. On the other hand Transactions DB used for online or short historical data based on product type and requirements.
